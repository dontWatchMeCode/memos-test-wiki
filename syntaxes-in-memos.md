## Intro

In memos, we use our own parser to display markdown-compatible content.

In this page, you will learn all syntaxes you can use in your memo content.

## Supported markdown syntax

If you are not familiar with markdown, please refer [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to get started.
We try to support all of these syntaxes.

It is worth noting that the content after the horizontal rule will be hidden by default after the folding memo option is enabled.

There are still some syntaxes that we don't support now.

- [ ] Heading
- [ ] Table (removed)
- [ ] Footnote
- [ ] Definition List
- [ ] Emoji
- [ ] Highlight
- [ ] Subscript
- [ ] Superscript

## Something special

1. Just like github's editor, you can directly write plain links
1. `#` followed by text will be recognized as a tag, refer [Best practices to write a TAG](https://github.com/usememos/memos/wiki/Best-practices-to-write-a-TAG) to know more.
1. **Unlike markdown**, you don't need to press `Enter` twice to break a line
